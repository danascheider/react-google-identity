# React Google Identity [![Hippocratic License HL3-FULL](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Hippocratic%20License&message=HL3-FULL&labelColor=5e2751&color=bc8c3d)](https://firstdonoharm.dev/version/3/0/full.html)

`react-google-identity` is a library supporting Google's identity services for React. It is compatible with React 17 and higher. The only alternative library supporting Google's identity services is [`react-google-login`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-login), which is incompatible with React 18 and doesn't seem to be maintained anymore.

`react-google-identity` is under development and has not yet been released.

I am looking for community support and co-maintainers for this tool as I don't have the bandwidth or executive function to be consistent about maintaining it on my own. Pull requests are welcome.
