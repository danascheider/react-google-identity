# React Google Identity [![Hippocratic License HL3-FULL](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Hippocratic%20License&message=HL3-FULL&labelColor=5e2751&color=bc8c3d)](https://firstdonoharm.dev/version/3/0/full.html)

`react-google-identity` is a library supporting Google's identity services for React. It is compatible with React 18. The only alternative library supporting Google's identity services is [`react-google-login`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-login), which is incompatible with React 18 and doesn't seem to be maintained anymore.

`react-google-identity` is under development and has not yet been released. Contributions are encouraged!

## TypeScript Support

`react-google-identity` doesn't currently support TypeScript as it isn't needed for my own initial use case. Absent community contributions, I will add TypeScript support when I switch my project over to TypeScript in the near future.

## License

`react-google-identity` is licensed under the [Hippocratic License v. 3.0](https://firstdonoharm.dev/) (HL3), a license developed by the [Organization for Ethical Source](https://ethicalsource.dev/) to regulate the activities in whose service a piece of software may be used. From the web site:

> The Hippocratic License 3.0 aims to confront the potential harms and abuses technology can have on people's fundamental human rights. It provides leverage for open source communities to establish a clear set of ethical standards that licensees must abide by in order to adopt their code.

The HL3 is a modular license, enabling licensors to choose modules that are in line with their particular values. `react-google-identity` uses the full license, including all modules. Information about the modules is available [here](https://firstdonoharm.dev/build/), the full text of the license is also included [in this repo](/LICENSE.md).

## Contribute

I am looking for community support and co-maintainers for this tool as I don't have the bandwidth or executive function to be consistent about maintaining it on my own. Pull requests are welcome.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to @anthonyjgrove, author of the original [`react-google-login` library](https://github.com/anthonyjgrove/react-google-login), which was instrumental for figuring out how to implement this library.
